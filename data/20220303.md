## Hello, world!

Hi, I am Hisam. A software engineer. Officially this is my first blogpost that I publish online, but actually I often make my own private notes/diaries, which is *private*.

I'd like to tell you a short story first about how I came up with the idea of writing a blog. It all started with an app, [Focused](https://setapp.com/apps/focused). I tried this app while exploring a lot of apps on Setapp Store. And I was hooked.

The zen mode is really amazing and help me focused, then I started to produce a lot of writings and I decided to share it to the world.

So, as a greetings, *"Hello, world!"*.

## Why?

Why a blog? The answer is pretty straight, *I want to give back to communities*.

I do believe, as a software engineer, all of us are being helped by a lot of great detailed blog post out there. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is great, but a blog has its own strength.



## Future

I would like to fill this blog with some technical blogs, related to software development. Since as a Software Engineer, I have a lot of things in my mind.

I would like to fill this blog with a new writing every week. But who knows, maybe I can do more (or worse, less). But I set a strict goal for myself.
