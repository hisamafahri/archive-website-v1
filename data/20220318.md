## The Gear

As you might notice, I am a Software Engineer. Every single day I open up my [code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) writing some codes, reading a lot of documentations, debugging things, designing the system, etc. That’s basically what I have been doing every single day.

But, I am also a reader, I always spare my time to read and write some of my thoughts on my book, or (mostly) on my [Notion](https://notion.so).

## The Shift

While most of the times I code a lot (like really a lot), but I am not really sure why I tend to more enjoy writing about my thoughts instead of writing about more technical stuff. 

I read a lot of books and found that sharing it to the world, sharing what I have learned, what are my thoughts about a topic or an idea, are much more fun to write to.

But to be fair, I really enjoy my time writing some technical stuff. But, looking at my schedule and my works, I think write some casual stuff and my ideas are much more productive in terms of the amount of total of posts I can make instead of the tech stuff.

## Expectation

I am really expecting this blog to be more casual than I first thoughts. But, as long as I am enjoying the process of reading and writing, it’s really more than enough for me. But, you will definitely see some tech stuffs that I really interested in covered in this blog.
